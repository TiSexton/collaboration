		<p><h1>What is Sticky Rice?</h1></p>

			<p>Sticky rice is a refined long-grain rice that has been growing in mainland Southeast Asia for at least 4,000 years. It is often called "sweet rice" or "glutinous rice" due to its naturally semi-sweet flavor and its gluten-like texture. Glutinous rice has a high amount of amylopectin which gives the grains their sticky texture once steamed.

			<p>Sticky rice is the national staple of Laos. Laos is the only country where sticky rice is the main rice. You might know of sticky rice from eating at Thai or Vietnamese restaurants, but Lao people eat more sticky rice than any group or people in the world. It is the foundation of almost every Lao meal. They have it as part of their breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack and even dessert. Laotians call sticky rice <b><i>Khao Niaow</i></b>. <i>Khao</i> means rice and <i>Niaow</i> means sticky.
			</p>

			<p><b>How does one eat Khao Niaow you ask?</b>  When cooked, sticky rice sticks together in one big mass and is eaten with your hands. But first, let me tell you about a thing called <b><i>Thip Khao</i></b>. Sticky rice is always stored in a bamboo basket called <i>thip khao</i>. A thip khao is a communal storage basket for cooked sticky rice. All you have to do is reach in the basket and grab a <i>small</i> handful. You should form a few bite-sized balls of rice to use as an edible utensil. You can use those little ball of rice to pick up whatever food, meat, vegetable or side dish that is presented. Spoons, forks or other utensils are not normally used when eating sticky rice. Some prefer to simply dip their sticky rice in spicy sauces called <b><i>chiaw</i></b>. The rice absorbs the <i>chiaw</i> like a sponge. Laotians love all kinds of <i>chiaw</i>. But that's a whole other story. 
			</p> 

			<p>Now that you know the basics of <i>Khao Niaow</i>, you can now go to your favorite Lao restaurant and eat it like a native. And remembe, you can eat sticky rice with any meal and all the meats.
